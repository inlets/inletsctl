## Examples

Examples on how to run `inletsctl` to create an exit node.

Pre-reqs:

* You will need [inlets](https://inlets.dev/) on your client

Workflow:

* After running `inletsctl create`, the IP address of your exit-node will be returned along with a sample `inlets client` command, for instance:

  ```sh
  Inlets OSS exit-node summary:
    IP: 209.97.131.180
    Auth-token: qFyFzKYQvFSgtl7TM76p5SwWpmHaQGMT405HajiMzIYmwYVgJt1lvAMXfV4S3KlS

  Command:
    export UPSTREAM=http://127.0.0.1:8000
    inlets client --remote "ws://209.97.131.180:8080" \
          --token "qFyFzKYQvFSgtl7TM76p5SwWpmHaQGMT405HajiMzIYmwYVgJt1lvAMXfV4S3KlS" \
          --upstream $UPSTREAM
  ```

* You can delete your exit node using the `id` given by your cloud provider

  ```sh
  inletsctl delete --access-token-file ~/Downloads/do-access-token --id 164857028
  ```

### Example usage with DigitalOcean

```sh
inletsctl create --access-token-file $HOME/Downloads/do-access-token \
  --region="nyc1"
```

## Example with inlets-pro

Let's say we want to forward TCP connections to the IP `192.168.0.26` within our client's network, using inlets-pro, we'd run this using the `--remote-tcp` flag.

```sh
inletsctl create digitalocean --access-token-file ~/Downloads/do-access-token \
  --remote-tcp 192.168.0.26
```

### Example usage with Scaleway

```sh
# Obtain from your Scaleway dashboard:
export TOKEN=""
export SECRET_KEY=""
export ORG_ID=""

inletsctl create --provider scaleway \
  --access-token $TOKEN
  --secret-key $SECRET_KEY --organisation-id $ORG_ID
```

The region is hard-coded to France / Paris 1.

### Add another cloud provisioner

Add a provisioner by sending a PR to the [inlets-operator's provision package](https://github.com/inlets/inlets-operator/tree/master/pkg/provision), once released, you can vendor the package here and add any flags that are required.

> Note: only clouds that support cloud-init can be added
